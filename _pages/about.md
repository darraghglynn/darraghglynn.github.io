    <p>
      I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Warwick interested in **algebraic geometry**, **complex dynamics** and **topology**, and in particular Hurwitz spaces, Thurston maps and tropical geometry. My supervisor is [Rohini Ramadas](https://sites.google.com/view/rohini-ramadas/home?authuser=1). I am an organiser for the [Dynamics and Group Geometry Early Researchers (DAGGER)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/dagger/) seminar at Warwick.
