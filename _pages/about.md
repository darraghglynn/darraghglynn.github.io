I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Warwick, with interests in algebraic geometry, complex dynamics and topology, and in particular Hurwitz spaces, Thurston maps and tropical geometry. My supervisor is [Rohini Ramadas](https://sites.google.com/view/rohini-ramadas/home?authuser=1). I am an organiser for the [Dynamics and Group Geometry Early Researchers (DAGGER)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/seminars/areas/dagger/) seminar at Warwick.
